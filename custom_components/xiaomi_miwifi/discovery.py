"""Mesh correlation and peer discovery for Xiaomi MiWiFi.

Only the gateway (router mode 0) knows the mesh topology, so it drives
everything: for each leaf it either links the already-configured device via
`via_device`, or fires an integration_discovery flow so the user can add it.

Correlation/discovery is best-effort and is wrapped so it can NEVER break
entry setup — any failure is logged and swallowed.
