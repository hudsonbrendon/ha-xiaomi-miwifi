Monitor and control **Xiaomi / MiWiFi routers** in Home Assistant over the local LuCI HTTP API. Mesh-aware: add each router as its own entry and the gateway auto-discovers and links its mesh peers. Powered by [`python-xiaomi-miwifi`](https://github.com/hudsonbrendon/python-xiaomi-miwifi).

## Installation (HACS)

1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → add `https://github.com/hudsonbrendon/ha-xiaomi-miwifi`, category **Integration**.
2. Install **Xiaomi MiWiFi**, restart Home Assistant.
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Xiaomi MiWiFi**.
4. Enter the router host (e.g. `192.168.31.1`) and admin password.

## Services

- `xiaomi_miwifi.add_dhcp_reservation` — reserve an IP for a MAC.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.remove_dhcp_reservation` — remove a reservation.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.block_device` — block a device from the network by MAC.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.unblock_device` — unblock a previously blocked device by MAC.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.luci_request` — perform a read-only GET to any MiWiFi LuCI API path and return the JSON response (e.g. `api/misystem/router_info`).
- `xiaomi_miwifi.run_speed_test` — trigger an on-device WAN speed test (briefly saturates the link).
- `xiaomi_miwifi.add_port_forward` — add a single-port forwarding rule (ip, name, proto, source_port, dest_port).
- `xiaomi_miwifi.delete_port_forward` — delete a port forwarding rule by its external (source) port.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.set_dmz` — forward all unmatched WAN traffic to a single LAN host.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.clear_dmz` — disable DMZ forwarding.
- `xiaomi_miwifi.set_ddns` — enable or disable dynamic DNS.

## Events & automation triggers

The integration fires bus events as devices come and go, and exposes matching device-automation triggers:

| Event | Trigger | Payload |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `xiaomi_miwifi_device_connected` | A device connected | `mac`, `name`, `ip` |
| `xiaomi_miwifi_device_disconnected` | A device disconnected | `mac` |
| `xiaomi_miwifi_new_device` | A new device joined | `mac`, `name`, `ip` |

## Multiple routers & mesh discovery

Each router is added as its own config entry with its own full set of entities. To add a mesh, set up the gateway first: the integration reads its mesh topology and automatically surfaces every peer node as a discovery flow ready to add. Peers also show up on their own when they appear on the network via DHCP. Because discovery reuses the admin passwords already stored on your other entries, adding a peer usually needs no extra input.

Discovered peers are linked under their gateway via `via_device`, so the device hierarchy in Home Assistant mirrors your physical mesh.

> **Breaking change (0.7.0):** mesh nodes are no longer exposed as per-leaf child sensors under the gateway entry — each router is now its own entry. Entries are also keyed by router MAC instead of host; existing entries are migrated automatically on upgrade.

## System Health & Repairs

- **System Health** (Settings → System → Repairs → System information) shows router count, reachability, firmware version, connected devices, and mesh nodes.
- **Repairs** raises informational issues when a firmware update is available or when the router model is not in the supported table.

## Reauthentication & reconfigure

- If the router rejects the stored password, Home Assistant starts a **reauthentication** flow to enter the current password.
- The **reconfigure** option (integration ⋮ menu) lets you change the router host and password without removing the entry.

## Options

Open the integration's **Configure** dialog to set:

- **Update interval** (seconds) — polling cadence.
- **Consider-home** (seconds) — how long a device is still reported home after it stops responding.
- **Excluded MACs** — comma-separated MAC addresses to ignore for presence and events.
